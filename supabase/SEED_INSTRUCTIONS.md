# 🚀 Populating Sample Data

To make the dashboard look alive with data, I've created a seed script.

## Instructions

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**
   👉 https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ulmankwcywixowwsvujf/sql/new

2. **Run the Seed Script**
   Copy and paste the code from `supabase/SEED_DATA.sql` and run it.

   This will add:
   - A "Demo Studio" organization (matching your Dev Login)
   - 3 Sample Clients
   - 5 Sample Leads (New, Contacted, Qualified, Won)

3. **Refresh Your Dashboard**
   Go back to `http://localhost:3002/dashboard` and refresh!
